# ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF INDIAN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS 

## INTRODUCTION

This Project is primarily focused on analyzing the dataset of Indian exports and imports and identifying data patterns. 
Foreign trade includes import and export. Importing is the purchase of foreign goods and services by a nation's inhabitants, businesses, and government.
Regardless of how they are brought into the country. They can be sent, emailed, or even carried aboard an aircraft in one's personal luggage. 
When a nation imports more than it exports, it has a trade imbalance. When a nation imports less than it sells, a trade surplus is formed.
As a result of globalization, Indians now have more access to foreign goods and services, while the Subcontinent has expanded its export market. 
trade in both directions has become an integral aspect of India's economy. The percentage of GDP attributed to imported goods and services in India was 27.8 percent in 2021. 

## APPROACH

This project was executed using the Python programming language and Jupyter notebook. 
The data set utilized contains export and import data from various countries.
We have performed various analyses, including Largest import, Highest Trade Balance, Lowest Trade Balance, 
Import vs. Export for Top 10 Countries with the Highest Total Trade, and 
Trade Balance for Top 10 Countries with the Highest Total Trade.
